# ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Dutch National Flag Algorithm

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` containing only **three distinct values**: `0`, `1`, and `2`.

Your task is to **sort the array in-place** such that:

- All `0`s come first,
- Followed by all `1`s,
- Followed by all `2`s.

This problem is known as the **Dutch National Flag problem**, proposed by Edsger Dijkstra.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input

- An array `arr[]` of length `n` where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output

- Modify the array **in-place** to group the elements in the order: `0s`, then `1s`, then `2s`.

---

## ðŸ§  Examples

### Example 1

```
Input:  [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

### Example 2

```
Input:  [2, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

### Example 3

```
Input:  [0]
Output: [0]
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `arr[i] âˆˆ {0, 1, 2}` for all valid indices `i`

---

## âœ… Approach: Dutch National Flag Algorithm

This is a **three-pointer approach**:

- **Low pointer (`low`)**: Marks the end of the `0`s section.
- **Mid pointer (`mid`)**: Current index under consideration.
- **High pointer (`high`)**: Marks the start of the `2`s section.

### Steps:

1. Initialize:  
   `low = 0`, `mid = 0`, `high = n - 1`

2. Loop while `mid <= high`:
    - If `arr[mid] == 0`: Swap with `arr[low]`, increment both `low` and `mid`
    - If `arr[mid] == 1`: Leave it, just increment `mid`
    - If `arr[mid] == 2`: Swap with `arr[high]`, decrement `high`

3. Continue until all elements are in place.

## ðŸ§  Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` â€” Every element is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` â€” Sorting is done in-place using pointers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- No sorting algorithm (like QuickSort or MergeSort) is used.
- Works only when the array contains exactly three distinct known values.
- Efficient and widely used in problems involving **categorical data** with 3 states.
